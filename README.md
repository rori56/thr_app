As part of my Project Zomboid gaming server creation, I made a PHP based website to manage their game account.
Its working with the Project Zomboid DB server to manage accounts.

It is made for hardcore server with death = ban.

If a player dies, he will be able to redeem a new character and get an other chance.

All players have a counter of how many lives they have.
